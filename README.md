Project Duration: 20150101 - 20180101

First personal project, focusing on getting some introduction on using the SteamSDK, as well as the workflow for publishing updates onto the steam platform.

Code architecture is obviously far from optimal, due to the learning process along development. However many concepts understood during the journey has and will be put to use in projects current and future.
