# TileDynasty
DESCRIPTION Looking to bring the old arcade-game feeling back from nostalgia. With bright neon-lights whizzing by while Bunny-hopping travel through the Arena, and check out our Online game modes with your friends.
<br>
<br>
Project Duration: 20150101 - 20180101
<br>
<br>
First personal project, focusing on getting some introduction on using the SteamSDK, as well as the workflow for publishing updates onto the steam platform. This is a large project folder due to many assets not in use within the project, as it contributed to the purpose of exploring Unity's features.
<br>
<br>
Code architecture is obviously far from optimal, due to the learning process along development. However many concepts understood during the journey has and will be put to use in projects current and future.
